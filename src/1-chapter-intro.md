# Creating a Minimal System

This first chapter will build a minimal Linux kernal that you can play around with 
meaningfully. By that,
I mean that I want to be able to run a shell, edit files, and mess around! 

However, a decent amount of preparation has to be done up to that point, and there's
a lot that can be learnt in that process.

We'll be starting by building the tool that we will be using inside the Linux kernel: busybox.
